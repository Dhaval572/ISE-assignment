# Assignment: Software Process Models

## 1. Define Software. Explain the features of good software.

### Definition:
Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is intangible and classified into system software, application software, and utility software.

### Features of Good Software:
- **Functionality**: Performs required tasks effectively.
- **Reliability**: Provides consistent performance without failures.
- **Efficiency**: Uses system resources optimally.
- **Usability**: Easy to use with a friendly interface.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and fix errors.
- **Portability**: Can run on different systems with minimal changes.

## 2. List The Four Types of Software with Examples and Explanation.

1. **System Software** – Manages hardware (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS).
2. **Application Software** – User-centric programs (e.g., MS Office, Photoshop).
3. **Embedded Software** – Runs on hardware devices (e.g., firmware in washing machines).
4. **Utility Software** – Enhances system functionality (e.g., antivirus, disk cleanup).

## 3. Distinguish Program and Product (Software).

| Feature         | Program | Product |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| Scope         | Limited task | Full software solution |
| Audience      | Individual use | Commercial/mass users |
| Maintenance   | Minimal | Regular updates & support |

---

## 4. Define Software Engineering. Explain its Necessity.

### Definition:
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to software development, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and maintainability.

### Necessity of Software Engineering:
- Manages software complexity.
- Ensures high quality and reliability.
- Reduces development and maintenance costs.
- Improves software scalability and usability.

---

## 5. Explain Layered Technology Approach of Software Engineering with Diagram.

Software engineering follows a layered approach with four main layers:

1. **Quality Focus** – Ensures reliability.
2. **Process Layer** – Defines development workflow.
3. **Methods Layer** – Includes techniques and models.
4. **Tools Layer** – Software used for development.

*(Include a diagram to represent these layers.)*

## 6. Describe Generic Framework Activities and List Umbrella Activities.

### Generic Framework Activities:
- Communication
- Planning
- Modeling
- Construction
- Deployment

### Umbrella Activities:
- Risk management
- Configuration management
- Quality assurance
- Documentation
- Maintenance

---

## 7. Define Software Life Cycle and Software Life Cycle Model.

### Software Life Cycle:
The stages a software product goes through from inception to retirement.

### Software Life Cycle Model:
A structured framework defining the phases in software development.

---

## 8. List the Need of a Documented Life Cycle Model.

- Ensures clarity in development stages.
- Helps manage project timelines.
- Provides a structured approach to software development.
- Improves maintainability and quality.

---

## 9. Explain the Phase Entry and Exit Criteria of Life Cycle Model.

Each phase in a life cycle model has defined **entry** (prerequisites) and **exit** (deliverables) criteria to ensure smooth progress.

- **Entry Criteria:** Approval of previous phase deliverables, availability of required resources.
- **Exit Criteria:** Completion of phase objectives, verification of outputs.

---

## 10-15. Explanation of Different Software Development Models:

1. **Classical Waterfall Model:** Sequential approach with distinct phases.
2. **Iterative Waterfall Model:** Allows feedback and refinements.
3. **Evolutionary (Incremental) Model:** Develops software in small parts.
4. **Prototyping Model:** Builds an initial prototype before final development.
5. **Spiral Model:** Focuses on risk assessment and iterative refinement.
6. **Comparison of Models:** Each model has unique advantages and use cases.

---

## 16. List the Value Statements of the Agile Manifesto.

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

---

## 17. Explain Twelve Principles of Agile Software Development.

1. Satisfy customers through continuous delivery.
2. Welcome changing requirements.
3. Deliver working software frequently.
4. Business people and developers must collaborate.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
6. Use face-to-face communication.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Maintain a sustainable development pace.
9. Continuous technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity is essential.
11. Self-organizing teams create the best solutions.
12. Regularly reflect and adjust.

---

## 18. Describe Agile Software Development Model.

Agile focuses on iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration, ensuring flexibility and faster delivery.

---

## 19. Difference Between Agile Model and Iterative Waterfall Model.

| Feature | Agile Model | Iterative Waterfall Model |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| Flexibility | Highly flexible | Less flexible |
| Feedback | Continuous | At each iteration |
| Development Speed | Faster | Slower |

---

## 20. Explain Agile Model SCRUM With Diagram.

SCRUM is an agile framework with roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Team), events (Sprints, Stand-ups), and artifacts (Backlog, Burndown charts). 

*(Include SCRUM diagram.)*

---

## 21. Explain Extreme Programming (XP).

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile methodology emphasizing customer satisfaction, continuous testing, and frequent releases. Key practices include:

- Pair programming.
- Test-driven development.
- Continuous integration.

---

## Conclusion:

This unit covers various software process models, software engineering principles, and agile methodologies, essential for efficient software development.
